# Airline Customer Satisfaction: End-to-End MLOps Pipeline ✈️

This project implements a complete **MLOps workflow** for predicting airline customer satisfaction.  
It covers data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, experiment tracking, CI/CD automation, and deployment on AWS.  

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Pipeline (Airflow + Postgres)**  
  Developed ETL pipeline to load data from REST API into Postgres with Python-based extraction.  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  Built features and trained models like **LightGBM, XGBoost**, achieving **94% accuracy** on 100K+ airline records.  

- **MLOps Automation**  
  - **DVC** for data & model version control  
  - **MLflow** for experiment tracking  
  - **TensorBoard** for performance visualization  

- **CI/CD & Deployment**  
  - Flask app deployed via **Jenkins CI/CD**  
  - Containerized with **Docker**  
  - Hosted on **AWS** with Load Balancer
